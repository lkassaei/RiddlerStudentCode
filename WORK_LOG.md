I initially did this with a nested loop, where after I found a space at i, I would loop backwards from that position with j until the beginning of the string and just check if j was another space. This became error prone and complicated so I switched to just using an index and while loop where while the index was not a space I would simply decrease the index.<br/> |

I mistakenly first used substring(i, i+9) thinking that I needed to compensate for the end of substring being exclusive. However, I realized that because i is zero-indexed, substring(i, i+8) already accounts for that. Then, I forgot to advance the loop index by 8 after I had taken a binary chunk, resulting in overlapping substring errors. I first tried i+=8 within the loop, but that combined with the automatic i++ at the end of the loop made me accidentally skip the next character. So I just did i+=8 within the loop boundary instead. |

Then I stumbled on something called Unicode, where emojis has hexadecimal codes corresponding to them. I converted the encrypted string to hexadecimal numbers to see if those could convert into ASCII, but got very high numbers that ASCII doesn't have. I am not sure how to proceed from there unfortunately. |
